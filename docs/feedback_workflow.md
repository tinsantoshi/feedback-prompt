# Real-Time Prompt Feedback Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the workflow for providing real-time feedback on prompts as users type them. The workflow is designed to be efficient, responsive, and provide valuable guidance to users crafting prompts for LLMs.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Input Capture
- User begins typing in a prompt input field
- Input is captured in real-time using event listeners
- Text changes are streamed to the feedback component

### 2. Initial Processing
- Input is preprocessed to normalize text
- Basic statistics are calculated (length, complexity, etc.)
- Input is checked against a set of predefined patterns and heuristics

### 3. Tiered Evaluation
The evaluation happens in tiers to balance speed and quality:

#### Tier 1: Immediate Heuristic Feedback (1-5ms)
- Check prompt length (too short/long)
- Detect basic structural issues
- Identify common prompt patterns
- Flag obvious issues (ambiguity, vagueness)

#### Tier 2: Local Model Evaluation (50-100ms)
- Use a lightweight local model to evaluate prompt quality
- Apply more sophisticated heuristics
- Generate basic improvement suggestions

#### Tier 3: LLM-Based Evaluation (300-500ms)
- Send prompt to LLM for comprehensive evaluation
- Generate detailed feedback and suggestions
- Create improved prompt versions

### 4. Feedback Generation
- Compile feedback from all evaluation tiers
- Prioritize feedback based on importance
- Format feedback for display
- Generate specific, actionable suggestions

### 5. Real-Time Display
- Display feedback indicators in real-time
- Update feedback as user continues typing
- Highlight specific parts of the prompt that need attention
- Offer inline suggestions

### 6. User Interaction
- Allow users to accept/reject suggestions
- Provide option to apply suggested improvements automatically
- Enable users to request more detailed feedback
- Support saving effective prompts as templates

## Feedback Categories

### Clarity
- Is the prompt clear and specific?
- Does it avoid ambiguity?
- Is the instruction explicit?

### Context
- Does it provide necessary context?
- Is background information sufficient?
- Are assumptions made explicit?

### Structure
- Is the prompt well-organized?
- Does it follow a logical flow?
- Are different parts clearly separated?

### Constraints
- Are limitations clearly defined?
- Are output requirements specified?
- Are format expectations clear?

### Examples
- Are examples provided when needed?
- Are examples relevant and clear?
- Do examples demonstrate desired output?

## Implementation Considerations

### Debouncing
- Implement debouncing to prevent excessive evaluation calls
- Default debounce time: 300ms for Tier 2, 500ms for Tier 3
- Allow customization of debounce settings

### Caching
- Cache feedback for similar prompts
- Use fuzzy matching to identify similar prompts
- Expire cache entries after a configurable time

### Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic feedback and progressively add more detailed insights
- Show immediate feedback while more comprehensive analysis is processing
- Indicate when more detailed feedback is being generated

### Customization
- Allow users to prioritize feedback categories
- Support domain-specific evaluation criteria
- Enable custom feedback rules
